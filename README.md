# Avni Web Page Clone

A beginner-friendly, responsive web page inspired by the [Avni Project](https://avniproject.org/).  
This is a **simple static web page** built using HTML and CSS as a personal learning project to improve my UI/UX and front-end design skills.

## 🔍 About the Project

It was created to practice:

- Responsive web design
- Clean layout structuring
- Mobile-friendly styling
- Visual consistency and spacing

The project is not connected to the official Avni team — it’s made purely for practice and learning purposes.
